# 4x4 Multiplexed LED Matrix

I always wanted to learn how to drive an LED Matrix so I went for it and designed the PCB, its a 4 by 4 grid driven by 8 io pins on an arduino NANO.

Price for 5 boards:
- Manufacturing $2.00
- Shipping $17.80
- Components $428.40MXN / 25.71 US dollars
- TOTAL: $55.51
>[!NOTE] Components will be bought locally hence the price in MXN
